Command Line Interface
======================

The :program:`numina` script is the interface with the pipelines
It is called like this::

     $ numina [global-options] comands [comand-options]

The :program:`numina` script has several options:

.. program:: numina

.. option:: -d, --debug

   Debug enabled, increases verbosity.

.. option:: -l filename

   A file with configuration options for logging.

Options for run
===============
The run subcommand processes the observing result with the
appropriated reduction recipe.

It is called like this::

     $ numina [global-options] run [comand-options] observation-result.yaml

.. program:: numina run

.. option:: --insconf, --profile UUID

   UUID of one of the instrument configurations. It overrides the
   configuration selected from the images (keyword INSCONF).

.. option:: --profile-path path

   Directory with additional instrument configurations.

.. option:: -p, --pipeline 'name'

   Name of one of the pipelines of the DRP. It overrides the pipeline
   of the observation result, the default is 'default'.

.. option::  -r, --requirements filename

   File with the description of the parameters of the recipe
   (control file, in format 1). It is validated with the schema
   ``control-schema.json`` of :mod:`numina.schemas`, the errors
   show where the file is not valid.

.. option:: --basedir path

   File path used to resolve relative paths in the following options.

.. option:: --datadir path

   File path to the folder containing the pristine data to be processed.

.. option:: --db FILE

   Registry of the reductions, relative to basedir. It is created if it
   does not exist. The tasks, results and products of the reductions are
   recorded in it, and later reductions use them: a product is the most
   recent one in the registry with quality control different from BAD,
   for the same instrument, profile and tags. The values given with
   ``--parameter-NAME=VALUE`` and in the requirements of the observation
   result have priority over the registry, and the products of the control
   file and of calibsdir are used if there is none in the registry.
   It overrides the value of ``file`` in the section
   ``[tool.db]`` of the configuration. With the registry, the templates of
   the directories are read from ``[tool.db]``, and they include the id of
   the task.

.. option:: --copy-files

   Copy the files of the observation result and the requirements
   to the work directory.

.. option:: --link-files, --not-copy-files

   Link the files of the observation result and the requirements
   in the work directory. Without --copy-files or --link-files, the
   value of copy_files in the configuration is used, by default
   the files are linked.

.. option:: -e, --enable BLOCKID

   enable a block listed in the observation result

.. option:: --validate

   Validate the inputs and the results of the recipe. Without this
   option, the value of validate in ``[tool.run]`` of the configuration
   is used, by default the inputs and results are not validated.

   Each input is validated with its type. For the observation result,
   each raw image is checked with the function that the DRP of the
   instrument registers in :data:`numina.core.config.check` (the same
   used by ``numina verify``), as the raw image type of the observing
   mode (``rawimage`` in ``drp.yaml``), and then the observation result
   is checked with the validator of the mode (``validator`` in
   ``drp.yaml``). If the DRP does not register a function, the raw
   images are not checked.

   If an input is not valid, the reduction stops before running the
   recipe, with an error that lists the invalid inputs. The results
   are validated after the recipe runs.

.. option:: observing_result filename

   Filename containing the description of the observation result.

Options for show-instruments
============================
The show-instruments subcommand outputs information about the instruments
with available pipelines.

It is called like this::

     $ numina [global-options] show-instruments [options]

.. program:: numina show-instruments

.. option:: -o, --observing-modes

   Show names and keys of Observing Modes in addition of instrument
   information.

.. option:: name

   Name of the instruments to show. If empty show all instruments.

Options for show-modes
======================
The show-modes subcommand outputs information about the observing
modes of the available instruments.

It is called like this::

     $ numina [global-options] show-modes [options]

.. program:: numina show-modes

.. option:: -i, --instrument name

   Filter modes by instrument name.

.. option:: name

   Name of the observing mode to show. If empty show all observing modes.

Options for show-recipes
========================
The show-recipes subcommand outputs information about the recipes
of the available instruments.

It is called like this::

     $ numina [global-options] show-recipes [options]

.. program:: numina show-recipes

.. option:: -i, --instrument name

   Filter recipes by instrument name.

.. option:: -m, --mode

   Filter recipes by observing mode.

.. option:: name

   Name of the recipe to show. If empty show all recipes.

Options for verify
==================
The verify subcommand checks files with the checks that the DRP of their
instrument registers in :data:`numina.core.config.check`, the same used by
``numina run --validate``. It is useful to discard raw images with
incomplete headers before reducing them.

It is called like this::

     $ numina [global-options] verify [options] files

Each file is reported in one line, as ``OK``, ``INVALID`` (with the reason)
or ``NOT CHECKED`` (the instrument has no checks, the image has no
``INSTRUME``, or the file is not a FITS or JSON file), followed by a summary::

    $ numina verify r0001.fits r0002.fits
    OK r0001.fits
    INVALID r0002.fits: HDU 0: 'VPH' is a required property
    1 valid, 1 invalid, 0 not checked

The exit status is 1 if some file is invalid, and 0 otherwise.

.. program:: numina verify

.. option:: --mode MODE

   Check the images as the raw images of the observing mode MODE (or
   INSTRUMENT.MODE, if several DRPs have a mode with that name), instead
   of the type deduced from their headers.

.. option:: --ob

   The files are observation results. Each raw image is checked as the raw
   image of the observing mode, and then the observation result with the
   validator of the mode, as with ``numina run --validate``. Not allowed
   with :option:`--mode`.

.. option:: --datadir path

   Directory of the raw images of the observation results. By default,
   the value of datadir in ``[tool.run]`` of the configuration.

.. option:: files

   The files to check: FITS images and JSON files or, with :option:`--ob`,
   observation results.
